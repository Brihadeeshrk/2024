this month i'm going to be venturing into a concept that i've wanted to learn for over a year. its super important to know, so my bad for not knowing it till now, but better late then never. so, this month, i'm going to be learning about microservices, docker, kube and all of that stuff. this is going to take a lot longer than a month (my opinion), but damn, i'm ready

# why microservices?

sure its a flashy term and is a `buzz` word but why do we use it and what benefits do we get?

- scalability
  - each service can be scaled independently depending on the demand
  - which is better resource management as only the components that are needed more are scaled
- flexibility in tech stack
  - polyglot programming - diff services can be written in diff langs and diff technologies
  - easier to integrate new tech and tools in specific services
- fault isolation
  - failure in 1 service doesnt bring down the entire network
  - simpler recovery as only the service that has been affected needs to be brought back up
- faster ci cd
  - smaller and more manageable codebases which are easier to develop, deploy and test
- organisational alignment
  - decentralised approach
  - aligns with agile and scrum where each team can take up a service and work fast
  - clear ownership when it comes to which team does what
- easier maintenance and updates
  - since everything is modular, changes can be made independently without affecting other services
- better security
  - service level security - security measures can be implemented at the (micro)service level, reducing attacks
  - isolation of sensitive data - data can be stored in an isolated service making it easier to secure
  - q> but also this way you only have to attack one service for all the data. then what?
- optimised for cloud and devops
  - containerization - suited for containerized en, scaling and deploying on cloud envs
  - service discovery and load balancing
- better perf
  - reduced latency - services can be geographically districuted to be closer to the end user
  - resource optimisation

# fundamentals

## what is a microservice

- a **monolithic** contains all the routing, all the middlewares, all the biz logic and all the db access code req to implement all the features of our application
- now, a single **microservice** contains all the routing, all the middleware, all the biz logic and all the db access code to implement **one feature** of our application
- all of the services are self sufficient, so every service has all the code required to make it work perfectly, most likely will have its on DB also
- each system/service is standalone and doesnt depend on any other service.

## some big challenges when working with MS

1. data mgmt between services
   - how data is stored in a service and how we can communicate with other services
   - why this is a challenge?
   - in MS, the way we store and access data is a bit weird
     - we're usually going to give every service a db, if it doesnt need one, we're not going to give it one
     - services will never ever reach into another service's db
     - this property of every service getting its own is a pattern called "database-per-service"
     - we want every service to run independently of other services
     - db schema/structure might change unexpectedly
       - lets just say (for the sake of the arg) that service A is accessing service B's db
       - service B changed the schema of their db but didnt inform A, now A is expecting a value but receives something else instead.
     - some services might function more efficiently with diff types of db's (sql v nosql)
   - so, how then do we communicate between services?
   - there are 2 comm strategies btw services - **SYNC** and **ASYNC** and NO, the dont have the same meaning as the JS async and sync keywords
   - SYNC - services communicate with each other using direct requests. it doesnt have to be a HTTP req or anything, it can be in any form but its a DIRECT req
     - UPSIDES
       - conceptually easy to understand
       - this service that is interacting doesnt need a db
     - DOWNSIDES - gigantic operational downsides
       - introduces a dependency between this new service and the services whose data is necessary
       - if any inter service req fails, the overall req fails
       - the entire req is only as fast as the slowest req
       - can introduce a web of requests
   - ASYNC - services communicate with each other using EVENTS
     - APPROACH 1 (not so great)
       - going to intro smthn that is accessible from all the services, referred to as an EVENT BUS
       - the job of the EVENT BUS is handle notifs/ events being emitted from the diff services
       - these notifs/ events are like obj that describe smthn that has happened or is going to happen inside our app
       - all the services are connected to this bus, and every service can either emit or recv events from this bus
       - so the service that needs data from other services would emit an event to the bus with a type property and some data
       - and this bus can automatically handle incoming events and route them off to diff services that might be able to handle it. so the bus might forward this event to say, service A
       - so when A has the result, it would emit another event, and we could configure the bus in a way such that if the type of the event is of a particular type, we could tell it to forward it to the service that needs the data
       - not the best way as it is basically sync communication but its not even easy to understand conceptually
     - APPROACH 2
       - just like db per service pattern, async comm is going to seem bizarre and inefficient
       - so what we're going to do is, first rephrase the task this new service is going to do and break up specifically, mark the ips and the ops so you know what is needed
       - then, create a db with this schema for this service
       - and now the question arises, how will this new service have the data thats stored in other services?
       - so along with storing the data in their respective dbs, we also emit an event to the event bus and this event is passed onto this new service, and this service populates its db and then if it has the req data, it returns it to the user
     - ADVANTAGES
       - this way, the new service has 0 dependancies on other services
       - service D will be extremely fast
     - DISADVANTAGES
       - data duplication. paying for extra storage + extra db
       - harder to understand (conceptually)
