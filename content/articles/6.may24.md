so this month, taking the advice of one of the smartest people [i know](https://anu18.com/), I'll be taking up or rather, ill be trying to get in-depth understanding of React and its testing library.

so, for this, we're going to come across a vite app shows 6 random products as soon as the app loads, now every product has a thumbnail, a category, a title, a price and a "add to cart" button
if the user scrolls down, theres a "Load More Products" button that gives the user 6 more products.

so what sort of tests can we write for this project?
for this lets understand the processes that occur
app loads -> 6 products are shown -> press load more button -> 6 more products are shown

so if you think about it, we can write 2 tests in this scenario
one test to check if 6 products are shown as soon as the app launches
and one more test to check if 6 more products are shown when we click on the button

so in our project we create a file called `App.test.js`

```js
import { render, screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import user from "@testing-library/user-event";
import App from "./App";

test("shows 6 products by default", async () => {
  // going to write a fn thats going to render our Apo component
  render(<App />);
  const titles = await screen.findAllByRole("heading");
  expect(titles).toHaveLength(6);
});

test("Clicking on the button shows 6 more products", async () => {
  render(<App />);
  const button = await screen.findByRole("button", {
    name: /load more/i,
  });
  user.click(button);
  await waitFor(async () => {
    const titles = await screen.findAllByRole("heading");
    expect(titles).toHaveLength(12);
  });
});
```

lets start off with a list of packages that we'll end up using when we talk about testing a react application.

1. `@testing-library/react` - takes our component and renders it, and gets it ready for testing.
2. `@testing-library/user-event` - helps simulate user input like typing and clicking. for this, BTS we're using another lib called `@testing-library/dom`. now, this package is already included in our proj with `@testing-library/react` and this `/dom` package helps us find eles that are rendered by our components
3. `jest` - runs our tests, reports results
4. `jsdom` - simulates a browser when running in a node env

now, when we just ran `yarn test` how is it that all the tests were run automatically?

> so `jest` finds all files in the src folder that end with `.spec.js`, or `.test.js` or are placed in a folder called `__test__`

## test writing process for the first project

1. pick out one component to test in isolation
2. make a test file for the component
3. decide what the imp parts of the component are
4. write a test to make sure all the parts of the components work as expected
5. run test at cmdline

### WRT UserForm component

what are the most imp parts of this component?

1. show 2 inputs and 1 button
2. enter a name + email and then submitting the form calls the onUserAdd callback to be called

```jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import user from "@testing-library/user-event";
import UserForm from "./UserForm";

test("check for 2 inputs and a button", () => {
  // render the component
  render(<UserForm />);
  // check if the inputs and the button are being rendered
  const inputs = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");
  // assertion: to make sure that the component is behaving as expected
  expect(inputs).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## queries

- a super imp part of testing is finding the ele that our component has created.
- query fns are how we are going to find eles that our component has rendered
- tedious to find eles
- there are about 48 fns that are used to find eles
- these fns are provided by the RTL Query System
- some ones that are most probably used (no need to memorise)
  - screen.getByRole()
  - screen.findAllByDisplayValue()
  - screen.queryAllByRole()
  - screen.queryByRole()
  - screen.findByRole()
  - screen.queryByLabelText()
  - screen.findAllByTitle()
  - screen.findByTitle()
  - screen.getByLabelText()

### understanding the queries we wrote earlier in the UserForm test

```jsx
const inputs = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
const button = screen.getByRole("button");
```

- the role is referring to something known as an `ARIA role`
- Aria roles clarify the purpose of a HTML ele
- mostly used by screenreaders
- many html eles have an 'implicit', or automatically assigned role
- eles can be assigned a role manually also and even trained engineers do this incorrectly at times (not advised to do)

now, some roles are:

- 'heading' -> h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6
- 'list' -> ul li
- 'button' -> button
- 'link' -> a
- 'textbox' -> input, type="text"
- ... and much more

finding eles by this 'role' method is the preferred way of testing, and RTL pushes us to use this method

## assertions

basically telling the test file the expected behaviour
so to test this assertion we use the `expect` keyword which is a global keyword

and this expect always takes in a value and to this value we attach a fn called as a matcher, ie something like `.toHaveLength(2)` etc
there are MANY matchers, some provided by jest, some provided by RTL
