## Beginning

I stepped into February with the ambition to complete a few courses, one of which being [Micro-Frontends](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-2b3267d6-75f0-4d3f-ada0-1aae9fa77e97/). I truly had no idea the term `microfrontend` was even a thing.
I'd heard of `microservices` but microfrontend sounded intriguing so I thought i'd try explore a bit and see if its something that would interest me.
in all of the projects that i've worked on, i haven't really felt the need to implement a microfrontend architecture but i understand why its super important and i also understand how it could
save time and effort.

for those unfamiliar with microfrontend, here's a small section to help you get upto speed _(beginner-friendly)_

### Microfrontend

_throughout this example, `microfrontend` will be abbreviated as MFE or mfe_

to understand the need for mfes, let me give you an example. you're currently building an ecommerce website that has these 2 components, a product list component and a cart component.
let's say we take up the **"CLASSIC"** approach and build both of these pages in one application, we then have a Single Page Application (SPA) right?

don't think too much on which framework/platform you'd built it with, for now assume its plain html.

now, within these pages, we may have 100s of components, sections, input-fields etc.. which would make it very tedious to maintain and implement in **1** codebase, and this is known as a
**MONOLITHIC** application.

if we had to convert this "CLASSIC" application into a mfe application, how would we do it? we'd make the product-list a mfe, and the cart a mfe. now, we have **2** SEPARATE codebases
which makes everything a bit more easy to manage and implement.
But, you may think, when i tap on the "Add to Cart" button in the product-list mfe, how will that trigger a change in the cart component if they are separate?

This is where we use APIs. there will be NO direct communication between 2 mfes. so in this scenario how would this pan out? in the product-list mfe, upon tapping the "Add to Cart" button
we'd have to call an api that manages that users cart and tell it to add this too.

and in the cart mfe, we'd have to call an api to fetch the items in the users cart and also an api to manage this cart incase the user wants to increase the qty, remove the item etc..

_but, again, why use MFE?_

- one gigantic benefit we get is that these applications are now 2 separate apps.
  now, two different teams can work on these applns side-by-side in isolation since they have no dependency amongst each other. these teams, now working independently can choose whatever development
  style they want. you want to use React for the product-list? GO FOR IT. Does the other team want to use Vue for the cart? SURE!
- this way, if one team makes a breaking change, the other team is not affected.
- and this also makes the project easy to manage and understand

now that we have 2mfes, how do we show them on the browser? using a THIRD mfe known as a **CONTAINER**

a container decides when and where to show the mfes we've created.

_thats it for a small intro into microfrontends_

### Intriguing concepts

some aspects of this learning journey i found really intriguing are

- built time integration
- run time integration
- server side integration
- webpack

_to know more on what these 3 are, [click here](https://2024.briha.xyz/posts/microfrontends#understanding-build-time-integration) to read my article_

here are the topics i made notes and learnt about in this course:

- microfrontends, and their need in a modern web application
- understanding integrations
- webpack
  - webpack dev server
  - implementing moduleFederationPlugin
  - understanding moduleFed config options
  - sharing dependencies among remote apps
- implementing a CI/CD pipeline with Github actions
- how to develop with a production style workflow
- issues with styling when it comes to microfrontend apps
- working with Navigation in a microfrontend apps
  - react router
  - history router
  - browser router
  - memory router
  - hash router (only definition and differences)
  - separation of routing options in dev and prod (browser in dev and memory in prod for remote apps)
- communication between microfrontend apps
- authentication in microfrontend apps
  - simple flow (no backend involved)
