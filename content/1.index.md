Hey, This is a simple md blog powered by nuxt that i cloned from [here](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/alpine).

Throughout the year, I've committed to learning something new each month, whether it's a new programming language or a fresh framework.
This blog serves a _dual_ purpose: it's a resource for those on a similar learning journey, offering essential takeaways from my experiences.
Additionally, it functions as a personal notebook where I document key points and insights for my future reference.

In addition to documenting key takeaways for fellow readers, I'll be working on a monthly project related to my learning journey.
Throughout each project, I'll share my experiences, including challenges faced and lessons learned, creating a space not just for information but for practical insights and personal growth.

the code for technical skills i may learn can be found [here](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/the-notebook)
